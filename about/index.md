I am a recent graduate of Colgate University where I double majored in Philosophy and International Relations with a strong focus on foreign languages such as Spanish and Japanese. I have posted a collection of essays I wrote during college that I am particularly fond of in the event anyone finds them interesting or looks me up. In my spare time I read slice of life mangas and play some video games every now and then -- such as Elden Ring and Hades.

你好，我是一名刚刚从小牙膏大学毕业的学生 :)。在大学里，我主修哲学和国际关系，同时也完成了校内大部分西班牙语和日本语的课程。这个网站里的文章是我在大学期间写得最有意思的几篇文章，即使可能不是最有学术价值的。我闲暇时很喜欢阅读生活类漫画以及玩休闲游戏，例如艾尔登法环和哈迪斯。
